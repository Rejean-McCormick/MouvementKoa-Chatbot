Here is the rewritten **Orgo v2 Blueprint Section 8 - Scalability and
Modularity** with the requested corrections applied, including the
addition of shared escalation logic:

### Section 8: Scalability and Modularity

This section explains how Orgo is designed to handle growing workloads
and adapt to diverse organizational needs. Updates include reusable
workflow components, such as shared escalation logic, to enhance
modularity and scalability.

### 8.1 Purpose of Scalability and Modularity

**Objective**:

-   Ensure Orgo grows with organizational needs, handling high email
    volumes and user loads efficiently and reliably.

-   Enable modular development, allowing workflows or features to be
    added or removed without disrupting core functionalities.

**Outcome**:

-   A scalable, modular system supporting both small teams and large
    enterprises with equal efficiency.

### 8.2 Modular Architecture

#### Core Modules:

-   **Email Parser**: Extracts metadata and identifies routing keywords.

-   **Rule Engine**: Processes workflows based on centralized YAML/JSON
    rules.

-   **Database**: Stores logs, workflows, and configurations.

-   **Task Manager**: Handles task escalations, notifications, and
    updates.

#### Customizable Modules:

-   Modules like Maintenance, HR, and Education can be added or removed
    as needed.

-   **Example**: Adding a disaster response module for emergency
    workflows without disrupting the core system.

### 8.3 Scalability Strategies

#### Task Queue Management

**Redis**:

-   Best for lightweight, real-time queues and caching.

import redis

queue = redis.StrictRedis(host=\"localhost\", port=6379\")

def enqueue_task(task_data):

queue.rpush(\"task_queue\", task_data)

**RabbitMQ**:

-   Ideal for advanced queuing with message durability and complex
    routing.

import pika

connection =
pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(\"localhost\"))

channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue=\"task_queue\", durable=True)

def enqueue_task(task_data):

channel.basic_publish(

exchange=\"\",

routing_key=\"task_queue\",

body=task_data,

properties=pika.BasicProperties(delivery_mode=2)

)

#### Database Optimization

-   **Sharding**: Split datasets across multiple PostgreSQL instances to
    handle large workloads.

-   **Read Replicas**: Use replicas to distribute query loads.

database:

shards:

\- host: \"shard1.organization.com\"

\- host: \"shard2.organization.com\"

replicas:

count: 2

#### Horizontal Scaling

-   Add servers or containers to distribute workloads.

-   Use Kubernetes for container orchestration.

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:

name: email-parser

spec:

replicas: 5

selector:

matchLabels:

app: email-parser

template:

metadata:

labels:

app: email-parser

spec:

containers:

\- name: email-parser

image: orgo/email-parser:v2

#### Caching

Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load.

def get_routing_rules():

cached_rules = redis.get(\"routing_rules\")

if not cached_rules:

cached_rules = fetch_from_database(\"rules\")

redis.set(\"routing_rules\", cached_rules, ex=3600)

return cached_rules

#### Load Balancing

Use tools like HAProxy or NGINX to distribute incoming requests.

-   **Example**: Route emails to the least-busy email parser instance.

### 8.4 Reusable Workflow Components

#### Shared Escalation Logic

A reusable function ensures consistent escalation handling across
workflows.

def escalate_task(task):

if not task_resolved(task):

notify_supervisor(task)

### 8.5 Example Use Cases

#### Small Organization

-   **Scenario**: A school with 50 staff and 500 students.

-   **Setup**: Single server deployment with SQLite for lightweight
    operations.

-   **Outcome**: Efficient handling of low email volumes with minimal
    infrastructure.

#### Medium-Sized Organization

-   **Scenario**: A municipal government handling 5,000 emails daily.

-   **Setup**: PostgreSQL database with read replicas, Redis for task
    queues and caching.

-   **Outcome**: Scalable workflows with reliable performance.

#### Large Enterprise

-   **Scenario**: A multinational corporation managing 50,000 emails
    daily.

-   **Setup**: Kubernetes cluster with Docker containers for core
    modules, RabbitMQ for task queue management, sharded PostgreSQL
    database with Redis caching.

-   **Outcome**: High availability and fast response times under heavy
    workloads.

### 8.6 Tools and Technologies for Scalability

-   **Task Management**: Redis or RabbitMQ for asynchronous task
    handling.

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL for sharded and replicated databases,
    SQLite for small-scale or offline setups.

-   **Load Balancing**: HAProxy or NGINX for distributing incoming
    requests.

### 8.7 Testing Scalability

#### Load Testing

Simulate increasing email volumes using tools like Locust.

-   **Example**: Test with 1,000, 10,000, and 50,000 emails per hour.

#### Stress Testing

Simulate server failures to evaluate recovery times with Kubernetes.

#### Module Testing

Add a healthcare module and validate its integration with existing
workflows.

### 8.8 Deliverables

-   **Scalability Plan**: Strategies for scaling hardware, databases,
    and workflows.

-   **Module Templates**: YAML/JSON configurations for adding or
    customizing modules.

-   **Performance Reports**: Results of load and stress tests.

### Summary

This section outlines strategies for scaling Orgo to meet diverse
organizational needs. By integrating reusable workflow components like
shared escalation logic and leveraging robust scalability tools, Orgo
ensures high availability and adaptability under varying workloads.
