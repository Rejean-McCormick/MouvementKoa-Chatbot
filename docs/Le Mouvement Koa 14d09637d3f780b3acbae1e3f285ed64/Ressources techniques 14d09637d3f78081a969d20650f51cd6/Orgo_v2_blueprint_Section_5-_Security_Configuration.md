Here's the rewritten **Orgo v2 Blueprint Section 5 - Security
Configuration** with the requested corrections integrated:

### Section 5: Security Configuration

This section defines the measures and configurations necessary to ensure
the security, privacy, and compliance of Orgo. The updates integrate
pseudonymization mapping, compliance-friendly audit trails, and advanced
encryption protocols.

### 5.1 Purpose of Security Configuration

**Objective**: Safeguard email communication and workflows against
unauthorized access, data breaches, and privacy violations.

**Outcome**: A secure platform that meets organizational and regulatory
requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

### 5.2 Core Security Features

#### Email Encryption

-   **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Encrypts email transmission
    between Orgo and the email server.

    -   **Mandatory Scenarios**: All general email communications (e.g.,
        maintenance requests).

    -   Example Configuration:

> smtp:
>
> host: \"smtp.organization.com\"
>
> port: 587
>
> tls: true
>
> username: \"orgo@organization.com\"
>
> password: \"securepassword\"

-   **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**: Encrypts sensitive email content
    using public-private key pairs.

    -   **Mandatory Scenarios**: Highly sensitive workflows (e.g.,
        harassment reports, patient data).

    -   Example Workflow:

        -   Sender encrypts the email with the recipient's public key.

        -   Only the recipient can decrypt it using their private key.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Ensures users can only access workflows and data relevant to their
roles.

-   **Example Roles**:

    -   Administrator: Full access to workflows and logs.

    -   HR Team: Access to harassment reports.

-   **Implementation Example**:

> CREATE TABLE roles (
>
> role_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
>
> role_name VARCHAR(50)
>
> );
>
> CREATE TABLE user_roles (
>
> user_id INT,
>
> role_id INT,
>
> FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
>
> FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(role_id)
>
> );

#### Sensitive Data Anonymization

Removes identifying metadata (e.g., sender email, name) for sensitive
workflows.

-   **Pseudonymization Mapping**:

> pseudonyms:
>
> \- id: user-1234
>
> real_id: employee@organization.com

-   Mapping files should be securely stored with access limited to
    authorized personnel only.

<!-- -->

-   **Audit Example**:

> \[2024-11-24T10:00:00\] Workflow: Harassment Report \| Reporter:
> user-1234

#### Secure Data Storage

-   **Encryption Standards**: AES-256 for emails, logs, and database
    content.

-   **Database Example**:

> CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
>
> INSERT INTO sensitive_data (encrypted_column)
>
> VALUES (pgp_sym_encrypt(\'Sensitive Content\', \'encryption_key\'));

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Adds a second authentication layer for administrators accessing Orgo's
backend.

-   **Tools**: Google Authenticator, Authy (TOTP).

#### Audit Logging and Monitoring

Logs all system actions for transparency and compliance.

-   **Examples of Logged Events**:

    -   Email parsing and routing decisions.

    -   Access attempts (successful or failed).

-   **Log Example**:

> {
>
> \"timestamp\": \"2024-11-24T12:34:56\",
>
> \"action\": \"Email Routed\",
>
> \"email_id\": \"12345\",
>
> \"from\": \"secretary@organization.com\",
>
> \"to\": \"maintenance@organization.com\",
>
> \"status\": \"success\"
>
> }

### 5.3 Compliance with Privacy and Security Standards

#### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

-   Pseudonymization and consent tracking for sensitive workflows.

-   Example: Anonymized harassment reports ensure no identifying details
    are exposed to unauthorized personnel.

#### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

-   Secure handling of patient information in healthcare workflows.

-   Example: Encrypted email transmission and storage for patient data.

#### Other Regional Regulations

Customizable for country-specific laws (e.g., CCPA, PIPEDA).

### 5.4 Security Workflow Examples

#### Harassment Reporting Workflow

1.  Employee sends a sensitive email to report@organization.com.

2.  Orgo anonymizes the sender (e.g., user-1234) and encrypts the email
    content using PGP.

3.  The email is routed to HR and legal advisors, with access restricted
    to designated roles.

4.  All actions are logged for compliance audits.

#### Maintenance Request Workflow

1.  Secretary sends a request to emergency@organization.com.

2.  Orgo logs the request, routes it to the maintenance team, and
    encrypts task details.

3.  Only team members assigned to the task can access the details.

### 5.5 Security Testing and Validation

-   **Penetration Testing**: Periodic tests to identify vulnerabilities
    in email handling, routing, and storage.

-   **Data Integrity Checks**: Validate that encrypted data can be
    decrypted only by authorized users.

-   **Access Control Validation**: Simulate role-based access to verify
    unauthorized users cannot access sensitive workflows.

### 5.6 Encryption Protocols

Example for AES-256 key storage and usage:

from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = b\'Sixteen byte key\'

cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CFB)

encrypted = cipher.encrypt(b\'Sensitive Data\')

### 5.7 Deliverables

-   **Security Policies**: Documentation for RBAC, encryption standards,
    and log retention.

-   **Configuration Files**: Predefined configurations for TLS, PGP, and
    database encryption.

-   **Test Reports**: Logs from penetration testing and role-based
    access simulations.

### Summary

This section ensures Orgo's workflows and data are protected through
robust security measures, including encryption, pseudonymization, and
access control. By complying with global privacy standards and
implementing rigorous logging, Orgo provides a secure and reliable
platform for handling sensitive communication.
