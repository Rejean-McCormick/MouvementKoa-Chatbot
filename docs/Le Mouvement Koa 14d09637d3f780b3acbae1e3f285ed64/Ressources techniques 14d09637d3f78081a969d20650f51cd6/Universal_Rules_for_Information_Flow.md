Universal Rules for Information Flow

I. Information Flow Principles

1\. Directional Flow Types:

Vertical:

Upward: Information escalates for approvals, feedback, or resolution.

Downward: Information disseminates directives, decisions, or updates.

Horizontal:

Intra-Departmental: Flows within the same team or functional area.

Inter-Departmental: Flows between teams to share or resolve tasks.

Networked (Circular):

Flows through multiple vertical and horizontal layers, often iterative.

2\. Dynamic Categorization:

Every piece of information is dynamically labeled using the vertical
axis (hierarchy) and horizontal axis (roles) to define:

Origin: The sender or initiating role.

Path: The flow direction and escalation path.

Destination: The final recipient or action point.

II\. General Rules

Rule 1: Function-Based Routing

Definition: Information flows based on responsibility and function.

Origin Role: The role initiating the information.

Intermediate Roles: Any roles required to process or act on the
information.

Final Role: The role with authority to resolve, approve, or broadcast
the information.

Guidelines:

The vertical axis determines the level responsible for action.

The horizontal axis identifies the team or department responsible for
processing.

Example:

A compliance report originates at Finance.Audit (horizontal) and flows:

Vertically: From 100.34 (Finance Department Head) → 2.34 (CFO) → 1.34
(CEO).

\-\--

Rule 2: Time-Based Escalation

Definition: Information escalates upward automatically if unresolved
within a defined timeframe.

Trigger: Task remains in an unresolved state.

Escalation Path: Moves to the next higher vertical level until resolved.

Guidelines:

Standard Timeframes:

Routine tasks: Escalate after 24--72 hours.

Critical tasks: Escalate immediately.

Escalation Stops:

The highest level capable of resolving the issue terminates the
escalation.

Example:

An unresolved IT request (1001.11.IT.Support) escalates:

After 2 hours: Escalates to 101.11.IT.Support (Team Lead).

After 4 hours: Escalates to 11.11.IT.Support (Department Head).

\-\--

Rule 3: Mass Communication via Special Levels

Definition: Broadcast information uses special levels to ensure
efficient distribution.

Special Levels:

10: Broadcast for Levels 1--9 (Executive Team).

100: Broadcast for Levels 11--99 (Department Heads).

1000: Broadcast for Levels 101--999 (Operational Staff).

Guidelines:

Information flows downward from the highest authority.

Recipients process and distribute further as necessary.

Example:

CEO broadcasts a strategic decision: 10.21 (Strategic Information →
Update).

\-\--

Rule 4: Role-Driven Collaboration

Definition: Information moves horizontally when inter-departmental or
cross-functional collaboration is required.

Horizontal Routing: Flows directly to the functional role best equipped
to handle the task.

Intermediary Roles: Include departments necessary for task resolution.

Example:

HR.Recruitment collaborates with IT.Support for new hire onboarding:

Label: 11.51.HR.Recruitment → 11.11.IT.Support.

\-\--

Rule 5: Categorization-Based Handling

Definition: The category and subcategory of information dictate how it
is handled.

Requests: Always flow upward for approval.

Updates: Shared horizontally or downward.

Decisions: Flow downward after resolution.

Reports: Move upward for analysis.

Distribution: Flow downward or horizontally to inform.

Example:

A financial decision flows upward to the CFO (2.73) and downward for
implementation.

\-\--

III\. Refined Workflow Categories

1\. Routine Tasks:

Horizontal flow within the team.

Upward escalation for unresolved tasks.

2\. Decision-Making:

Vertical flow upward for approval.

Downward flow for implementation.

3\. Mass Communication:

Downward flow through special levels (10, 100, 1000).

4\. Critical Escalations:

Immediate vertical flow to the highest responsible authority.

5\. Collaborative Workflows:

Horizontal flow across departments.

\-\--

IV\. Universal Template

1\. Routing

Trigger: Information is created (e.g., request, update, or report).

Path:

Routine: Horizontal or downward.

Escalation: Vertical if unresolved.

2\. Escalation

Time thresholds trigger upward movement:

Routine: 24--72 hours.

Critical: Immediate escalation.

3\. Notifications

Sender: Informed of status changes.

Recipient: Alerts for new tasks.

4\. Completion

Downward or horizontal flow for distribution after resolution.

\-\--

V. Example: Workflow for Budget Approval

1\. Initiation:

Department Head submits a budget request: 100.71.Finance.Budgeting.

2\. Routing:

Flows upward to CFO (2.71) for approval.

3\. Escalation:

If unresolved after 3 days, escalates to CEO: 1.71.

4\. Completion:

Approval is distributed to operational staff: 1000.72.Finance.

\-\--

Refined Benefits of the Rules

1\. Flexibility:

Applies uniformly across infinite cases without specific customization.

2\. Efficiency:

Time-based and role-driven routing ensures fast resolution.

3\. Clarity:

Labels ensure precise identification of sender, category, and recipient.

4\. Scalability:

Adapts easily to organizations of any size or complexity.
