Cyclic Overview System for Pattern Recognition

Purpose

A cyclic overview system ensures that all reported cases, whether
resolved, unresolved, or minor, are periodically reviewed to identify
emerging patterns. This system prevents systemic issues from being
overlooked by connecting isolated cases into actionable insights.

I. Key Components of the Cyclic Overview System

1\. Case Categorization:

Every reported case is assigned a label that includes:

Vertical Axis: Level responsible for the case.

Category and Subcategory: Nature of the case (e.g., compliance, safety).

Horizontal Role: Functional area (e.g., HR.Policy, Operations.Safety).

2\. Case Logging:

Each case is logged with:

Details: Description, timestamp, action taken.

Status: Resolved, unresolved, or pending.

Tags: Contextual markers (e.g., location, equipment, behavior).

3\. Cyclic Review Frequency:

Cases are reviewed weekly, monthly, and yearly to identify patterns:

Weekly: Focus on critical cases and immediate concerns.

Monthly: Review accumulated trends across departments.

Yearly: Comprehensive analysis of systemic patterns.

4\. Threshold Triggers:

Predefined thresholds trigger automatic escalation:

Example: 5 similar incidents in 6 months require further investigation.

II\. Workflow for Cyclic Overview

1\. Initial Reporting

A case is entered into Orgo, assigned a label, and routed to the
appropriate role:

Label: 1001.91.Operations.Safety

Vertical: Staff (1001).

Category: Crisis and Emergency (9).

Subcategory: Request (1).

Horizontal: Operations.Safety.

Action: Logged in the system, tagged, and assigned to the responsible
role.

\-\--

2\. Immediate Action

Responsibility-Based Routing:

Routed to the lowest level capable of addressing the case (e.g., Safety
Officer).

Logging:

Status updated after resolution (e.g., \"Floor cleaned, resolved\").

Label updated: 11.94.Operations.Safety.Resolved.

\-\--

3\. Weekly Review

Purpose: Review critical cases and unresolved issues.

Process:

1\. Generate a list of all new and unresolved cases from the past week.

2\. Highlight cases that:

Remain unresolved.

Show signs of escalation.

3\. Escalate unresolved cases or those marked as critical:

Example: A near-miss reported 3 times in one week is flagged for
investigation.

\-\--

4\. Monthly Review

Purpose: Identify short-term trends across departments.

Process:

1\. Aggregate all cases by department, category, or location:

Example: \"5 wet floor incidents reported in Operations in 1 month.\"

2\. Compare against thresholds:

Example: 3 incidents of the same type in 1 month trigger further
investigation.

3\. Generate a monthly audit report for leadership:

Label: 11.94.Operations.Safety.Audit.

Outputs:

Escalate patterns that cross thresholds to department heads or
leadership.

Recommendations for immediate policy changes.

\-\--

5\. Yearly Review

Purpose: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of systemic issues.

Process:

1\. Combine all resolved, unresolved, and escalated cases into an annual
report.

2\. Use pattern recognition to highlight systemic risks:

Example: \"15 near-miss incidents involving Machine A over 1 year.\"

3\. Assess the effectiveness of past actions:

Did warnings or actions reduce incident frequency?

4\. Generate a yearly systemic review report:

Label: 2.94.Leadership.Safety.Review.

Outputs:

Leadership receives a detailed analysis of trends and recommendations.

Strategic actions are proposed (e.g., equipment upgrades, training).

\-\--

III\. Threshold Triggers

1\. Incident Frequency:

Example: 5 similar incidents in 6 months trigger escalation.

2\. Cross-Departmental Trends:

Example: Multiple departments report similar issues (e.g., safety
hazards).

3\. High-Risk Indicators:

Example: Incidents involving specific equipment or locations flagged as
high risk.

\-\--

IV\. Outputs of the Cyclic Overview System

1\. Weekly Reports:

Focused on critical and unresolved cases.

Escalation of time-sensitive issues.

2\. Monthly Trend Reports:

Identify emerging patterns.

Propose short-term actions to address trends.

3\. Yearly Systemic Review:

Highlight long-term patterns.

Evaluate the effectiveness of previous actions.

Recommend strategic changes to prevent future risks.

\-\--

V. Benefits of the System

1\. Proactive Risk Management:

Patterns are identified before they escalate into crises.

2\. Accountability:

All cases, even resolved ones, are part of the long-term review process.

3\. Scalability:

Works for small organizations with a few cases and scales to large ones
with thousands.

4\. Transparency:

Leadership is consistently informed through periodic reviews.

VI\. Example Workflow: Wet Floor Reports

1\. Weekly Review:

\"3 wet floor reports logged this week.\"

Immediate actions reviewed; unresolved cases escalated to Safety
Officer.

2\. Monthly Review:

\"5 wet floor reports logged in the past month at the lobby.\"

Safety Officer flags pattern for audit: 11.94.Operations.Safety.Audit.

3\. Yearly Review:

\"15 wet floor reports over the year; 5 resulted in near-miss
incidents.\"

COO proposes systemic changes:

New floor signage and cleaning protocols.

Mandatory training for maintenance staff.

This cyclic system ensures no report is overlooked and patterns are
detected early, enabling proactive interventions.
