### **Rewritten Implementation Blueprint for Orgo**

This updated blueprint incorporates corrections to detail cross-module
dependencies, enhance integration workflows, and support
organization-specific configurations.

### **Implementation Blueprint for Orgo**

#### **Purpose**

The Implementation Blueprint outlines a detailed roadmap for designing,
deploying, and maintaining Orgo. This updated version enhances
modularity, scalability, and cross-module integration, emphasizing
workflows that align Infrastructure, Core Services, and Interfaces.

### **Key Elements of the Implementation Blueprint**

#### **1. System Architecture**

-   **High-Level Design**:

    -   Modular architecture supporting:

        -   Email-based workflows.

        -   Offline capabilities.

        -   Organization-specific dynamic configurations.

-   **Key Components**:

    -   **Email Servers**: Manage email-based task submissions.

    -   **Parsing Module**: Extracts actionable data from emails.

    -   **Rule Engine**: Dynamically loads routing and escalation rules.

    -   **Database**:

        -   PostgreSQL for scalable operations.

        -   SQLite for offline mode.

    -   **Workflow Automation**: Manages task escalations and
        notifications.

    -   **Sync Engine**: Handles .pst files for offline operations.

-   **Integration Workflow**:

> Infrastructure → Core Services → Interfaces

-   **Example**:

    -   An email triggers a workflow via the parsing module.

    -   The task is routed through the rule engine.

    -   Notifications are sent via Interfaces.

#### **2. Functional Specifications**

-   **Core Features**:

    -   Role-based communication via email (e.g., hr@organization.com).

    -   Dynamic task routing and escalation.

    -   Offline synchronization using .pst files.

-   **Key Workflows**:

    -   **Maintenance Requests**: Automatically routes tasks to
        appropriate departments.

    -   **Harassment Reports**: Anonymizes and routes sensitive data.

    -   **Emergency Escalations**: Prioritizes critical tasks with
        dynamic escalation.

#### **3. Technological Stack**

-   **Languages**:

    -   Python for backend logic.

    -   Go for high-performance processing.

-   **Databases**:

    -   PostgreSQL for online use.

    -   SQLite for offline scenarios.

-   **Frameworks**:

    -   Flask or FastAPI for APIs.

    -   Django Admin for lightweight management.

-   **Protocols**:

    -   SMTP/IMAP for email handling.

#### **4. Deployment Plan**

-   **Steps**:

    1.  **Install Dependencies**: Python, PostgreSQL, and libraries.

    2.  **Configure Email Servers**: Secure with TLS and role-based
        addresses.

    3.  **Setup Offline Mode**:

        -   Configure .pst file synchronization.

        -   Use SQLite for local operations.

    4.  **Containerization**:

        -   Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes.

        -   Example: Multi-container orchestration via Docker Compose.

<!-- -->

-   **Integration with Core Services**:

    -   Infrastructure scripts (backup.py, sync.py) feed data into Core
        Services for task routing.

#### **5. Security Configuration**

-   **Encryption**:

    -   TLS for secure communication.

    -   AES-256 for data storage.

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

    -   Limits access to sensitive workflows.

-   **Anonymization**:

    -   Removes identifying data in logs and workflows.

#### **6. Workflow Integration**

-   **Dynamic Rule Loading**:

    -   Routing and escalation rules dynamically adjust based on
        /config/rules/.

    -   Example Rule:

> \- condition: \"subject contains \'urgent\'\"
>
> action:
>
> route_to: \"emergency@organization.com\"
>
> priority: \"high\"

-   **Cross-Module Dependency**:

    -   **Infrastructure → Core Services**:

        -   Sync offline data into PostgreSQL.

    -   **Core Services → Interfaces**:

        -   Route tasks and escalate via APIs.

-   **Preformatted Templates**:

    -   Example: Incident reports generated automatically.

#### **7. Testing and Validation**

-   **Unit Tests**:

    -   Validate workflows (e.g., parsing, routing, notifications).

-   **Integration Tests**:

    -   Simulate cross-module workflows (e.g., Maintenance to HR
        escalation).

-   **Performance Tests**:

    -   Test high email volumes (e.g., 100,000 emails/hour).

#### **8. Scalability and Modularity**

-   **Scalability Plan**:

    -   Redis for high-volume task queues.

    -   Dynamic organization types.

-   **Modular Design**:

    -   Industry-specific modules (e.g., healthcare, education).

#### **9. Logging and Monitoring**

-   **Audit Trails**:

    -   Logs workflow and routing actions.

-   **Monitoring Tools**:

    -   Elastic Stack for real-time metrics.

-   **Retention Policies**:

    -   Configured dynamically for each organization.

#### **10. Maintenance and Support**

-   **Self-Monitoring**:

    -   Automates health checks and email server uptime.

-   **Troubleshooting**:

    -   Documentation for resolving issues.

### **Integration Workflow Example**

**Scenario**: Offline Task Routing

1.  **Infrastructure**:

    -   A .pst file is uploaded via sync.py and stored in SQLite.

2.  **Core Services**:

    -   The rule engine processes tasks, resolving conflicts between
        SQLite and PostgreSQL.

3.  **Interfaces**:

    -   Notifications are sent to users via APIs.

### **Why the Implementation Blueprint Matters**

1.  **Clarity**: Provides a step-by-step guide.

2.  **Scalability**: Adapts to organizational growth.

3.  **Security**: Ensures sensitive data protection.

### **Conclusion**

This updated Implementation Blueprint integrates cross-module workflows
and organization-specific configurations, aligning with Orgo's goals for
modularity and scalability.
