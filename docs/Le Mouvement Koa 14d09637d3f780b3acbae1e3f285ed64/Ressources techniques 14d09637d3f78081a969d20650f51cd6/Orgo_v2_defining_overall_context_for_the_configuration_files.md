Here's how I would structure and phrase point 1 (defining overall
context for the configuration files) when asking AI to help with the
task:

Point 1: Define Overall Context

Prompt to AI: High-Level Overview

\> I am building configuration files for a system called Orgo. These
files will be used to initialize and configure the core services of the
system, such as email handling, database connections, and logging
mechanisms. The configuration files will be written in YAML format for
readability and modularity.

Details About the Configuration Files

1\. Email Configuration (email_config.yaml):

Contains settings for sending and receiving emails.

Includes SMTP server details, IMAP server details, and authentication
credentials.

2\. Database Configuration (db_config.yaml):

Defines connection settings for PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

Supports switching between online and offline modes.

3\. Logging Configuration (logging_config.yaml):

Specifies logging levels, file locations, and retention policies.

Includes configurations for activity logs, error logs, and security
logs.

Requirements for AI Output

\> When creating these files, please ensure the following:

1\. Structure:

Use nested keys for logical grouping (e.g., smtp inside email).

Follow consistent naming conventions for keys (e.g., smtp_server,
db_host).

2\. Placeholders:

Include placeholders for sensitive information like \<USERNAME\> and
\<PASSWORD\>.

3\. Comments:

Add comments explaining the purpose of each key-value pair.

4\. Readability:

Format the files for clarity, with proper indentation and alignment.

Expected Output

After providing this context, request the AI to create the pseudocode
for each configuration file to establish the structure.

\> \"Based on the above information, provide pseudocode for the
following files:

email_config.yaml: Include SMTP and IMAP configurations.

db_config.yaml: Include PostgreSQL and SQLite configurations.

logging_config.yaml: Include general logging settings, activity logs,
error logs, and security logs.\"

Example Output for email_config.yaml

Here's how AI should respond when asked for the pseudocode:

\# email_config.yaml

smtp:

server: \"\<SMTP_SERVER\>\" \# Address of the SMTP server

port: \<PORT_NUMBER\> \# SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS)

username: \"\<USERNAME\>\" \# Username for SMTP authentication

password: \"\<PASSWORD\>\" \# Password for SMTP authentication

encryption: \"\<TLS/SSL\>\" \# Encryption type (TLS or SSL)

imap:

server: \"\<IMAP_SERVER\>\" \# Address of the IMAP server

port: \<PORT_NUMBER\> \# IMAP port (e.g., 993 for SSL)

username: \"\<USERNAME\>\" \# Username for IMAP authentication

password: \"\<PASSWORD\>\" \# Password for IMAP authentication

Would you like me to proceed with the pseudocode generation for the
other files or draft specific YAML templates based on this structure?
