### **IV. Consolidation of Tasks Across Levels**

To maximize reusability and minimize complexity:

1.  **Universal Tasks**: These can be the core template for task
    management.

2.  **Cross-Industry Tasks**: These are derived by adding metadata or
    slight logic modifications to universal tasks.

3.  **Industry-Specific Tasks**: Built using a **modular approach**
    where common logic is extended with domain-specific features.

### **Unified Task Model**

A **generalized task management system** can dynamically handle all
tasks by combining these categories with metadata. Below is a database
schema and logic to handle them:

#### **Database Schema**

CREATE TABLE tasks (

id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

type VARCHAR(50), \-- Universal, cross-industry, or specific

category VARCHAR(50), \-- HR, maintenance, marketing, etc.

description TEXT, \-- Task details

status VARCHAR(20), \-- Pending, in-progress, completed

priority VARCHAR(20), \-- Low, medium, high

assigned_to VARCHAR(50), \-- Responsible person or team

deadline TIMESTAMP, \-- Deadline for completion

metadata JSONB \-- Custom data for specific tasks

);

#### **Logic for Dynamic Task Handling**

1.  **Task Creation**:

    -   Tasks are created by specifying type, category, and metadata for
        custom details.

2.  **Task Execution**:

> def execute_task(task):
>
> if task\[\"type\"\] == \"universal\":
>
> return handle_universal_task(task)
>
> elif task\[\"type\"\] == \"cross-industry\":
>
> return handle_cross_industry_task(task\[\"category\"\], task)
>
> elif task\[\"type\"\] == \"specific\":
>
> return handle_specific_task(task\[\"category\"\], task)

3.  **Modular Handlers**:

    -   **Universal Tasks**:

> def handle_universal_task(task):
>
> print(f\"Handling universal task: {task\[\'description\'\]}\")
>
> return True

-   **Cross-Industry Tasks**:

> def handle_cross_industry_task(category, task):
>
> print(f\"Handling {category} task: {task\[\'description\'\]}\")
>
> return True

-   **Specific Tasks**:

> def handle_specific_task(category, task):
>
> print(f\"Handling specific {category} task:
> {task\[\'description\'\]}\")
>
> if \"metadata\" in task:
>
> print(f\"Metadata: {task\[\'metadata\'\]}\")
>
> return True

### **Benefits of This Approach**

1.  **Scalability**:

    -   Adding new tasks requires minimal code changes; they are driven
        by database entries and dynamic handlers.

2.  **Modularity**:

    -   Shared logic reduces redundancy, while metadata allows
        customization for domain-specific needs.

3.  **Ease of Maintenance**:

    -   Categories and types allow structured growth without
        overwhelming complexity.

4.  **Reusability**:

    -   Universal and cross-industry logic handles most needs, while
        specific tasks are modularly extendable.
