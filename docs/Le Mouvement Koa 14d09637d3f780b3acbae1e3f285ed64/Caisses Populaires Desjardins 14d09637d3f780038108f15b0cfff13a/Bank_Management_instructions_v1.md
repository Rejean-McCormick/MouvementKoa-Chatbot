Core
 
Pillars
 
of
 
Success
1.
 
Financial
 
Health
 
○
 
Maintain
 
Robust
 
Proﬁtability
:
■
 
Balance
 
cost
 
management
 
with
 
targeted
 
investments
 
in
 
member
 
services
 
and
 
innovation.
■
 
Reinvest
 
portions
 
of
 
earnings
 
into
 
community
 
initiatives—like
 
local
 
business
 
grants
 
or
 
educational
 
programs—to
 
reinforce
 
Desjardins’
 
cooperative
 
ethos.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Set
 
annual
 
proﬁtability
 
targets
 
that
 
simultaneously
 
account
 
for
 
reinvestment
 
thresholds.
 
If
 
proﬁtability
 
exceeds
 
forecasts,
 
increase
 
community
 
outreach
 
funding
 
proportionally.
○
 
Innovation
 
and
 
Sustainability
:
■
 
Incorporate
 
sustainable
 
practices
 
(e.g.,
 
green
 
infrastructure,
 
paperless
 
operations)
 
into
 
ﬁnancial
 
planning.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Allocate
 
a
 
set
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
annual
 
budget
 
for
 
“green
 
transition”
 
projects
 
(e.g.,
 
upgrading
 
to
 
energy-efficient
 
systems),
 
tracking
 
ROI
 
through
 
cost
 
savings
 
and
 
reduced
 
carbon
 
footprint.
2.
 
Member
 
Value
 
○
 
Competitive
 
Financial
 
Products
:
■
 
Provide
 
interest
 
rates,
 
loan
 
terms,
 
and
 
dividends
 
that
 
rival
 
or
 
surpass
 
market
 
offerings—while
 
focusing
 
on
 
member-centric
 
objectives
 
like
 
fair
 
pricing
 
and
 
inclusive
 
access.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Periodically
 
benchmark
 
your
 
product
 
suite
 
against
 
peer
 
institutions.
 
If
 
rates
 
become
 
uncompetitive,
 
restructure
 
fees
 
or
 
dividends
 
to
 
preserve
 
Desjardins’
 
position
 
as
 
a
 
top
 
cooperative
 
option.
○
 
Enhanced
 
Accessibility
:
■
 
Target
 
underserved
 
communities
 
by
 
simplifying
 
account
 
setup,
 
lowering
 
minimum
 
balance
 
requirements,
 
and
 
offering
 
bilingual
 
or
 
multicultural
 
member
 
support.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Launch
 
speciﬁc
 
outreach
 
campaigns—like
 
“Banking
 
for
 
All”
 
fairs—that
 
educate
 
prospective
 
members
 
on
 
how
 
Desjardins’
 
services
 
align
 
with
 
their
 
needs.
 
Track
 
new
 
account
 
openings
 
to
 
measure
 
impact.
3.
 
Community
 
Impact
 

○
 
Social
 
and
 
Economic
 
Improvements
:
■
 
Prioritize
 
funding
 
for
 
local
 
projects
 
that
 
boost
 
regional
 
development
 
(e.g.,
 
incubators
 
for
 
small
 
entrepreneurs,
 
scholarships
 
for
 
youth
 
education).
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Establish
 
a
 
community
 
advisory
 
board
 
that
 
meets
 
quarterly
 
to
 
identify
 
high-impact
 
local
 
projects
 
deserving
 
of
 
Desjardins’
 
support.
○
 
Leadership
 
in
 
Local
 
Initiatives
:
■
 
Facilitate
 
ﬁnancial
 
literacy
 
workshops,
 
entrepreneurship
 
mentorship
 
programs,
 
and
 
networking
 
events
 
to
 
strengthen
 
community
 
ties.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Encourage
 
employees
 
to
 
volunteer
 
for
 
these
 
programs,
 
offering
 
time-off
 
incentives.
 
Publish
 
outcomes
 
(jobs
 
created,
 
businesses
 
launched)
 
to
 
showcase
 
progress.
4.
 
Resilience
 
○
 
Adaptable
 
Organizational
 
Structures
:
■
 
Anticipate
 
market
 
shifts,
 
technology
 
advancements,
 
and
 
regulatory
 
changes
 
by
 
embedding
 
ﬂexibility
 
in
 
operations
 
and
 
governance.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Conduct
 
annual
 
scenario-planning
 
exercises,
 
testing
 
Desjardins’
 
response
 
to
 
events
 
like
 
economic
 
downturns
 
or
 
sudden
 
ﬁntech
 
disruptions.
 
Adjust
 
processes
 
based
 
on
 
identiﬁed
 
vulnerabilities.
○
 
Continuous
 
Skill
 
Development
:
■
 
Train
 
employees
 
in
 
emerging
 
trends
 
(e.g.,
 
digital
 
banking,
 
ESG
 
compliance),
 
ensuring
 
Desjardins
 
can
 
quickly
 
pivot
 
to
 
meet
 
evolving
 
member
 
demands.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Introduce
 
a
 
structured
 
“Resilience
 
Curriculum”
 
offering
 
online
 
modules
 
on
 
crisis
 
management
 
and
 
data
 
analytics.

1.1.2
 
Balancing
 
Cooperative
 
Values
 
and
 
Financial
 
Competitiveness
1.
 
Cooperative
 
Values
 
○
 
Transparency
 
and
 
Participation
:
■
 
Involve
 
members
 
in
 
major
 
decisions—like
 
product
 
launches
 
or
 
community
 
investment
 
directions—through
 
surveys,
 
town
 
halls,
 
or
 
digital
 
voting
 
platforms.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Schedule
 
quarterly
 
“M ember
 
Policy
 
Forums”
 
to
 
solicit
 
input
 
on
 
proposed
 
changes
 
(e.g.,
 
new
 
loan
 
terms),
 
ensuring
 
decisions
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
broader
 
membership’s
 
voice.
○
 
Solidarity
 
and
 
Collective
 
Prosperity
:
■
 
Uphold
 
Desjardins’
 
founding
 
principle
 
of
 
mutual
 
aid,
 
ensuring
 
all
 
strategic
 
plans
 
prioritize
 
community
 
well-being
 
over
 
short-term
 
proﬁts.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
For
 
every
 
new
 
initiative,
 
require
 
a
 
brief
 
“Cooperative
 
Impact
 
Assessment”
 
to
 
articulate
 
its
 
beneﬁts
 
to
 
members
 
and
 
communities
 
(e.g.,
 
job
 
creation,
 
ﬁnancial
 
inclusion).
2.
 
Financial
 
Competitiveness
 
○
 
Modern
 
Banking
 
Tools
:
■
 
Adopt
 
data
 
analytics,
 
AI-driven
 
loan
 
underwriting,
 
and
 
user-friendly
 
digital
 
channels
 
to
 
meet
 
member
 
expectations
 
efficiently.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Periodically
 
review
 
digital
 
adoption
 
rates.
 
If
 
usage
 
is
 
low,
 
launch
 
targeted
 
education
 
sessions
 
or
 
streamline
 
user
 
interfaces
 
to
 
boost
 
engagement.
○
 
Economies
 
of
 
Scale
:
■
 
Collaborate
 
with
 
regional
 
caisses
 
to
 
centralize
 
back-office
 
tasks
 
(e.g.,
 
risk
 
management,
 
IT
 
infrastructure)
 
while
 
allowing
 
each
 
caisse
 
autonomy
 
in
 
community
 
engagement.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Form
 
task
 
forces
 
to
 
identify
 
duplication
 
of
 
services
 
and
 
propose
 
shared
 
solutions
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
centralized
 
call
 
center).
 
M easure
 
cost
 
savings
 
and
 
re-channel
 
them
 
into
 
member
 
beneﬁts.

1.1.3
 
Long-Term
 
Vision
 
for
 
Sustainable
 
Growth
1.
 
Sustainability
 
as
 
a
 
Guiding
 
Principle
 
○
 
Integrate
 
ESG
 
Factors
:
■
 
Incorporate
 
environmental,
 
social,
 
and
 
governance
 
considerations
 
into
 
product
 
design,
 
vendor
 
selection,
 
and
 
operational
 
decisions.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Develop
 
a
 
“Green
 
Scorecard”
 
for
 
products,
 
evaluating
 
carbon
 
footprint,
 
social
 
impact,
 
and
 
governance
 
metrics.
 
Use
 
this
 
scorecard
 
when
 
deciding
 
whether
 
to
 
launch,
 
continue,
 
or
 
discontinue
 
offerings.
○
 
Measurable
 
Sustainability
 
Targets
:
■
 
Set
 
clear
 
benchmarks
 
(e.g.,
 
30%
 
reduction
 
in
 
operational
 
carbon
 
footprint
 
within
 
ﬁve
 
years,
 
doubling
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
green
 
loans
 
each
 
year).
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Review
 
performance
 
against
 
these
 
targets
 
quarterly.
 
If
 
progress
 
lags,
 
reallocate
 
budgets
 
or
 
introduce
 
new
 
incentives
 
(like
 
better
 
loan
 
rates
 
for
 
eco-friendly
 
borrowers).
2.
 
Innovation-Driven
 
Growth
 
○
 
Emerging
 
Trends
 
in
 
Fintech
 
and
 
Regulation
:
■
 
Stay
 
ahead
 
of
 
regulatory
 
changes
 
(e.g.,
 
open
 
banking)
 
and
 
technological
 
developments
 
(e.g.,
 
AI-based
 
personalized
 
ﬁnance
 
advice).
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Establish
 
a
 
“Digital
 
Innovation
 
Council”
 
to
 
pilot
 
new
 
ideas—like
 
blockchain
 
for
 
secure
 
transactions—and
 
present
 
ﬁndings
 
to
 
the
 
Board
 
each
 
quarter.
○
 
Digital
 
Transformation
 
for
 
Accessibility
:
■
 
W hile
 
adopting
 
advanced
 
solutions,
 
ensure
 
members
 
lacking
 
digital
 
literacy
 
or
 
high-speed
 
internet
 
can
 
access
 
traditional
 
services.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
M aintain
 
a
 
minimum
 
branch
 
footprint
 
and
 
phone-based
 
services
 
for
 
remote
 
or
 
less
 
tech-savvy
 
members,
 
tracking
 
usage
 
to
 
balance
 
digital
 
and
 
offline
 
channels
 
effectively.

Embedding
 
Cooperative
 
Principles
 
into
 
Strategic
 
Decisions
●
 
Mission-Centered
 
Decision
 
Framework
 
○
 
Require
 
that
 
every
 
signiﬁcant
 
strategic
 
or
 
tactical
 
proposal
 
be
 
evaluated
 
against
 
cooperative
 
principles
 
before
 
approval.
■
 
For
 
instance,
 
when
 
considering
 
a
 
new
 
product
 
launch,
 
assess
 
whether
 
it
 
directly
 
serves
 
member
 
needs
 
or
 
community
 
welfare
 
alongside
 
proﬁtability
 
targets.
○
 
Encourage
 
scenario
 
planning
 
that
 
weighs
 
short-term
 
ﬁnancial
 
gains
 
against
 
potential
 
impacts
 
on
 
members
 
and
 
communities.
■
 
If
 
a
 
cost-cutting
 
measure
 
could
 
erode
 
service
 
quality,
 
develop
 
alternatives
 
that
 
retain
 
member
 
satisfaction.
●
 
Leadership
 
Alignment
 
○
 
Establish
 
overarching
 
strategic
 
objectives
 
that
 
each
 
Board
 
member,
 
executive,
 
and
 
manager
 
explicitly
 
commits
 
to
 
supporting.
■
 
Link
 
these
 
objectives
 
to
 
measurable
 
metrics—e.g.,
 
percentage
 
growth
 
in
 
member
 
equity
 
or
 
community
 
investments—so
 
that
 
alignment
 
is
 
both
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative.
○
 
Foster
 
frequent
 
dialogue
 
among
 
leadership
 
tiers
 
to
 
ensure
 
consistency
 
in
 
implementing
 
cooperative-driven
 
goals.
■
 
Host
 
quarterly
 
cross-functional
 
leadership
 
meetings
 
to
 
review
 
progress
 
on
 
shared
 
priorities
 
(e.g.,
 
improved
 
local
 
reinvestment
 
strategies,
 
increased
 
member
 
participation
 
in
 
governance).
●
 
Policy
 
Filters
 
for
 
Cooperative
 
Alignment
 
○
 
Develop
 
a
 
structured
 
checklist
 
or
 
“cooperative
 
lens”
 
to
 
evaluate
 
all
 
major
 
initiatives:
■
 
Member
 
Priority
 
Check
:
 
Does
 
the
 
initiative
 
enhance
 
member
 
well-being
 
or
 
address
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
member
 
need?
■
 
Environmental
 
and
 
Social
 
Alignment
:
 
Does
 
the
 
initiative
 
support
 
Desjardins’
 
sustainability
 
commitments
 
or
 
create
 
measurable
 
positive
 
community
 
impact?
■
 
Transparency
 
and
 
Participation
:
 
Can
 
members
 
easily
 
understand
 
and
 
inﬂuence
 
this
 
decision
 
if
 
necessary?
○
 
Incorporate
 
these
 
ﬁlters
 
into
 
existing
 
approval
 
processes,
 
ensuring
 
every
 
proposed
 
action
 
aligns
 
with
 
Desjardins’

that
 
directly
 
feed
 
into
 
the

○
 
Establish
 
a

○
 
Conduct
 
biannual

comparing
 
member

data
 
and
 
the
 
Bank’s
 
strategic

Assign
 
ultimate
 
responsibility
 
to
 
the
 
Board,
 
ensuring
 
alignment
 
with
 
Desjardins’
 
long-term
 
vision
 
and
 
cooperative
 
values.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Require
 
formal
 
Board
 
approval
 
for
 
initiatives
 
that
 
signiﬁcantly
 
affect
 
the
 
institution’s
 
mission,
 
ﬁnancial
 
stability,
 
or
 
brand
 
reputation.
○
 
Tactical
 
Decisions
:
 
Delegate
 
to
 
executive
 
committees
 
specializing
 
in
 
speciﬁc
 
domains
 
such
 
as
 
ﬁnance,
 
technology,
 
and
 
risk.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Empower
 
each
 
committee
 
with
 
a
 
well-deﬁned
 
scope
 
(e.g.,
 
product
 
innovation,
 
regional
 
market
 
expansion)
 
to
 
expedite
 
decisions
 
while
 
keeping
 
them
 
strategically
 
consistent.
○
 
Operational
 
Decisions
:
 
Entrust
 
to
 
management
 
teams
 
who
 
oversee
 
daily
 
execution.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Implement
 
performance
 
metrics
 
for
 
managers
 
that
 
tie
 
operational
 
decisions
 
(e.g.,
 
cost
 
controls,
 
productivity
 
enhancements)
 
back
 
to
 
cooperative
 
outcomes
 
(e.g.,
 
member
 
satisfaction).
●
 
Escalation
 
Protocols
 
○
 
Deﬁne
 
explicit
 
thresholds
 
that
 
trigger
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
higher-level
 
review.
■
 
Example:
 
If
 
an
 
operational
 
decision
 
may
 
exceed
 
a
 
set
 
budget
 
cap
 
or
 
substantially
 
alter
 
risk
 
proﬁles,
 
it
 
must
 
escalate
 
to
 
an
 
executive
 
committee
 
or
 
Board
 
for
 
approval.
○
 
M aintain
 
a
 
clear
 
communication
 
chain
 
so
 
that
 
urgent
 
issues
 
are
 
escalated
 
promptly
 
without
 
unnecessary
 
bureaucratic
 
delays.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Use
 
simple
 
decision
 
trees
 
and
 
digital
 
workﬂows
 
to
 
route
 
proposals
 
to
 
the
 
right
 
governance
 
body.

Meeting
 
Efficiency
●
 
Structured
 
Agendas
 
○
 
Pre-circulate
 
agendas
 
emphasizing
 
critical
 
decisions.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Require
 
each
 
agenda
 
item
 
to
 
state
 
a
 
clear
 
objective
 
(e.g.,
 
“Decision
 
Needed,”
 
“Discussion,”
 
“Informational
 
Update”)
 
to
 
ensure
 
focused
 
use
 
of
 
time.
○
 
Limit
 
meeting
 
frequency
 
and
 
duration
 
by
 
aligning
 
topics
 
with
 
each
 
governance
 
body’s
 
mandate.
■
 
Example:
 
Board
 
meetings
 
for
 
high-level
 
strategy
 
once
 
a
 
month;
 
executive
 
committees
 
convene
 
weekly
 
or
 
bi-weekly
 
as
 
necessary.
●
 
Timeboxing
 
○
 
Allocate
 
strict
 
time
 
limits
 
for
 
discussions
 
and
 
decisions:
■
 
Example:
 
10
 
minutes
 
for
 
presentations,
 
followed
 
by
 
10
 
minutes
 
of
 
Q&A.
○
 
Assign
 
a
 
timekeeper
 
to
 
enforce
 
adherence.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Conclude
 
each
 
agenda
 
item
 
with
 
a
 
clear
 
outcome
 
(decision
 
made,
 
deferred,
 
or
 
requires
 
further
 
analysis).
●
 
Digital
 
Asynchronous
 
Decision-Making
 
○
 
Implement
 
collaborative
 
platforms
 
(e.g.,
 
secure
 
board
 
portals,
 
team
 
messaging
 
apps)
 
for
 
routine
 
or
 
non-controversial
 
decisions.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Establish
 
a
 
48-hour
 
online
 
voting
 
window
 
for
 
minor
 
proposals,
 
reducing
 
meeting
 
load.
○
 
Provide
 
executive
 
summaries
 
and
 
rationale
 
electronically
 
so
 
stakeholders
 
can
 
vote
 
or
 
comment
 
at
 
their
 
convenience.
Crisis

Protocols
●
 
Pre-Approved
 
Frameworks
 
○
 
Develop
 
speciﬁc
 
action
 
plans
 
for
 
possible
 
crises
 
such
 
as
 
liquidity
 
shortfalls,
 
cybersecurity
 
breaches,
 
or
 
reputational
 
events.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
Store
 
crisis
 
playbooks
 
on
 
a
 
secure
 
digital
 
platform
 
accessible
 
to
 
leadership
 
during
 
emergencies.
○
 
Deﬁne
 
clear
 
triggers
 
(ﬁnancial
 
ratios,
 
media
 
coverage
 
thresholds,
 
or
 
regulatory
 
alerts)
 
that
 
activate
 
crisis
 
protocols.
■
 
Example:
 
If
 
the
 
Liquidity
 
Coverage
 
Ratio
 
(L CR)
 
dips
 
below
 
a
 
certain
 
threshold,
 
immediately
 
convene
 
the
 
Crisis
 
M anagement
 
Committee.

●
 
Delegation
 
of
 
Roles
 
○
 
Assign
 
designated
 
committees
 
or
 
task
 
forces
 
to
 
handle
 
crises
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
nature
 
(e.g.,
 
Financial
 
Crisis
 
Team,
 
Cybersecurity
 
Task
 
Force).
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip:
 
M aintain
 
an
 
up-to-date
 
contact
 
list
 
and
 
a
 
chain-of-command
 
chart
 
so
 
that
 
each
 
person
 
knows
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
without
 
confusion.
○
 
Authorize
 
expedited
 
decision-making
 
powers
 
for
 
these
 
committees
 
when
 
a
 
crisis
 
is
 
officially
 
declared.
■
 
Example:
 
The
 
Finance
 
Committee
 
can
 
unilaterally
 
approve
 
emergency
 
funding
 
lines
 
to
 
stabilize
 
liquidity.
By
 
implementing
 
these
 
streamlined
 
decision-making
 
frameworks,
 
optimizing
 
meeting
 
structures,
 
and
 
preparing
 
robust
 
crisis
 
protocols,
 
Desjardins
 
enhances
 
governance
 
agility.
 
This
 
ensures
 
the
 
leadership
 
can
 
respond
 
swiftly
 
to
 
market
 
and
 
operational
 
changes
 
while
 
maintaining
 
the
 
cooperative
 
principles
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
every
 
strategic
 
or
 
tactical
 
move.

M arket
 
risk
 
refers
 
to
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
ﬁnancial
 
losses
 
arising
 
from
 
changes
 
in
 
market
 
conditions—such
 
as
 
interest
 
rates,
 
foreign

rates,
 
and
 
broader
 
economic
 
shifts—that
 
can
 
affect
 
Desjardins’
 
asset
 
and
 
liability
 
portfolios.
 
Bank
 
directors
 
must
 
proactively
 
identify,
 
measure,
 
and
 
mitigate
 
these
 
risks
 
to
 
ensure
 
the

A
 
sudden

margins
 
if
 
deposit
 
rates
 
adjust

■
 
Aim
 
to
 
align
 
the
 
maturities
 
(or
 
durations)
 
of
 
assets

This
 
helps
 
reduce
 
volatility
 
in
 
net

when
 
rates
 
shift.
■
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Implement
 
a

gap
 
limit
 
(e.g.,
 
no
 
more
 
than
 
6
 
months’
 
mismatch
 
between
 
asset
 
and
 
liability
 
maturities).
 
Regularly
 
review
 
the

○
 
Deﬁnition
:
 
The

to
 
its
 
containment
 
or
 
resolution.

hours
 
for
 
minor
 
IT
 
outages)
 
and
 
track
 
actual
 
performance.
 
If
 
repeated
 
lags
 
occur,
 
reevaluate
 
escalation
 
and
 
resource
 
allocation
 
protocols.

Financial
 
Impact
 
Relative
 
to
 
Capital
 
Reserves
 
○
 
Purpose
:
 
Assess
 
the
 
monetary
 
damage
 
of
 
a
 
crisis
 
(losses,
 
ﬁnes,
 
missed
 
revenue)
 
compared
 
to
 
Desjardins’
 
capital
 
position.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
If
 
crisis-related
 
costs
 
exceed
 
a
 
predeﬁned
 
threshold
 
(e.g.,
 
5%
 
of
 
capital
 
reserves),
 
conduct
 
an
 
extraordinary
 
audit
 
to
 
explore
 
additional
 
resilience
 
measures—such
 
as
 
higher
 
reserve
 
targets
 
or
 
expanded
 
insurance
 
coverage.
By
 
implementing
 
a
 
robust
 
crisis
 
management
 
framework—covering
 
identiﬁcation,
 
response,
 
communication,
 
and
 
analysis—Desjardins
 
can
 
protect
 
member
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
institutional
 
viability
 

under
 
extreme
 
stress.
 
Bank
 
directors
 
should
 
routinely

and
 
reﬁne
 
these
 
procedures,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the

Advanced
 
Systems
 
for
 
M ember
 
Participation
A
 
thriving
 
cooperative
 
depends
 
on
 
active,
 
diverse
 
member
 
participation.
 
To
 
strengthen
 
democratic
 
processes
 
and
 
ensure
 
broad-based
 
engagement,
 
Desjardins
 
must
 
harness
 
digital
 
innovations
 
and
 
inclusive
 
meeting
 
formats.
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
strategies
 
and
 
actionable
 
steps
 
for
 
directors
 
to
 
consider:
Digital
 
Voting
 
and
 
Participation
 
Platforms
1.
 
Secure,
 
Accessible
 
Systems
 
○
 
Blockchain-Based
 
Solutions
:
 
Employ
 
blockchain
 
or
 
other
 
decentralized
 
technologies
 
to
 
guarantee
 
tamper-proof
 
voting.
 
This
 
ensures
 
that
 
each
 
vote
 
is
 
unique,
 
transparent,
 
and
 
veriﬁable
 
without
 
compromising
 
member
 
privacy.
○
 
Mobile-Optimized
 
Interfaces
:
 
Provide
 
user-friendly
 
mobile
 
apps
 
or
 
websites
 
that
 
allow
 
members
 
to
 
vote
 
and
 
comment
 
on
 
proposals
 
remotely,
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
travel
 
or
 
paper-based
 
ballots.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Run
 
pilot
 
programs
 
before
 
widespread
 
implementation.
 
Gather
 
feedback
 
on
 
system
 
usability
 
and
 
security
 
features.
 
Address
 
concerns
 
about
 
data
 
privacy,
 
and
 
provide
 
“how-to”
 
tutorials
 
for
 
less
 
tech-savvy
 
members.
2.
 
Multilingual
 
and
 
Inclusive
 
Access
 
○
 
Goal
:
 
Ensure
 
that
 
language
 
barriers
 
or
 
physical
 
limitations
 
do
 
not
 
exclude
 
any
 
member
 
from
 
exercising
 
their
 
voting
 
rights.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Offer
 
the
 
voting
 
platform
 
in
 
multiple
 
languages
 
commonly
 
used
 
among
 
Desjardins’
 
membership.
 
Incorporate
 
accessibility
 
features
 
(e.g.,
 
screen
 
readers,
 
large
 
text
 
options,
 
audio
 
prompts)
 
to
 
support
 
members
 
with
 
visual
 
or
 
auditory
 
challenges.
Real-Time
 
Participation
 
Analytics

○
 
Purpose
:
 
Provide
 
an
 
at-a-glance
 
view
 
of
 
voter
 
turnout,
 
demographic
 
breakdowns,
 
and
 
regional
 
participation
 
rates.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Set
 
minimum
 
participation
 
goals
 
for
 
each
 
voting
 
cycle.
 
If
 
certain
 
segments
 
(e.g.,
 
younger
 
members,
 
rural
 
regions)
 
show
 
consistently
 
low
 
turnout,
 

allocate
 
budget
 
for
 
targeted
 
outreach—such
 
as
 
local
 
awareness
 
campaigns
 
or
 
mobile
 
kiosk
 
demonstrations.
2.
 
Identifying
 
Underrepresented
 
Groups
 
○
 
Process
:
 
M onitor
 
participation
 
data
 
to
 
reveal
 
which
 
segments
 
are
 
not
 
engaging—whether
 
by
 
age,
 
region,
 
or
 
socioeconomic
 
status.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Develop
 
tailored
 
outreach
 
strategies—like
 
on-campus
 
info
 
sessions
 
for
 
students
 
or
 
specialized
 
workshops
 
for
 
rural
 
communities—and
 
measure
 
improvements
 
in
 
subsequent
 
votes
 
or
 
surveys.
Enhanced
 
Member
 
Meetings
1.
 
Hybrid
 
Meeting
 
Formats
 
○
 
Live-Streamed
 
Events
 
with
 
Q&A
:
 
Host
 
meetings
 
that
 
members
 
can
 
attend
 
in
 
person
 
or
 
virtually,
 
asking
 
questions
 
in
 
real
 
time.
 
This
 
broadens
 
geographic
 
reach
 
and
 
accommodates
 
those
 
with
 
scheduling
 
constraints.
○
 
Interactive
 
Workshops
:
 
In-person
 
venues
 
can
 
offer
 
hands-on
 
sessions
 
where
 
members
 
discuss
 
proposals,
 
brainstorm
 
solutions,
 
or
 
co-create
 
policy
 
ideas.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Use
 
professional
 
videography
 
and
 
stable
 
online
 
platforms
 
to
 
avoid
 
technical
 
glitches
 
that
 
deter
 
future
 
participation.
 
Archive
 
live
 
streams
 
so
 
members
 
can
 
revisit
 
discussions
 
or
 
catch
 
up
 
later.
2.
 
Pre-Meeting
 
Surveys
 
○
 
Purpose
:
 
Capture
 
key
 
member
 
concerns
 
and
 
topics
 
before
 
formal
 
meetings.
 
This
 
ensures
 
agenda
 
items
 
reﬂect
 
genuine
 
member
 
priorities.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Send
 
succinct
 
online
 
surveys
 
or
 
polling
 
questions
 
a
 
week
 
in
 
advance.
 
Share
 
summarized
 
results
 
during
 
the
 
meeting
 
to
 
affirm
 
members
 
that
 
their
 
input
 
shapes
 
discussions.
By
 
embracing
 
digital
 
voting
 
tools,
 
real-time
 
analytics,
 
and
 
hybrid
 
meeting
 
formats,
 
Desjardins
 
ensures
 
equitable
 
participation
 
opportunities
 
for
 
all
 
members—regardless
 
of
 
location,
 
language,
 
or
 
ability.
 
These
 
advanced
 
systems
 
not
 
only
 
boost
 
democratic
 
engagement
 
but
 
also
 
reinforce
 
the
 
cooperative’s
 
foundational
 
principle
 
of
 
member-driven
 
governance,
 
ultimately
 
resulting
 
in
 
decisions
 
that
 
better
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
diverse
 
voices
 
within
 
the
 
Desjardins
 
community.

4.2.2
 
Ensuring
 
Inclusivity
 
in
 
Governance
 
and
 
Representation
Inclusive
 
governance
 
at
 
Desjardins
 
not
 
only
 
strengthens
 
democratic
 
principles
 
but
 
also
 
enriches
 
decision-making
 
by
 
bringing
 
diverse
 
perspectives
 
to
 
the
 
table.
 
By
 
actively
 
identifying
 
and
 
addressing
 
representation
 
gaps,
 
simplifying
 
governance
 
access,
 
and
 
upholding
 
transparent
 
standards,
 
Desjardins
 
can
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
member
 
voices—regardless
 
of
 
background—contribute
 
to
 
shaping
 
the
 
institution’s
 
future.
Outreach

Identifying
 
Representation
 
Gaps
 
○
 
Approach
:
 
Analyze
 
membership
 
data
 
(e.g.,
 
age,
 
geographic
 
location,
 
income
 
levels,
 
cultural
 
background)
 
to
 
determine
 
which
 
groups
 
are
 
less
 
involved
 
in
 
elections,
 
committees,
 
or
 
governance
 
forums.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Conduct
 
periodic
 
“representation
 
audits”
 
using
 
both
 
quantitative
 
metrics
 
(voter
 
turnout
 
by
 
region
 
or
 
demographic)
 
and
 
qualitative
 
inputs
 
(focus
 
groups,
 
local
 
interviews)
 
to
 
understand
 
barriers.
2.
 
Empowering
 
Underrepresented
 
Voices
 
○
 
Leadership
 
Training
:
 
Offer
 
targeted
 
programs—like
 
short
 
workshops,
 
internships,
 
or
 
mentorships—that
 
build
 
leadership
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
younger
 
or
 
minority
 
members.
○
 
Local
 
Engagement
 
Campaigns
:
 
Organize
 
community
 
meetups
 
in
 
underrepresented
 
neighborhoods
 
or
 
partner
 
with
 
local
 
nonproﬁts
 
to
 
raise
 
awareness
 
of
 
cooperative
 
governance
 
opportunities.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Track
 
how
 
many
 
trained
 
individuals
 
go
 
on
 
to
 
hold
 
governance
 
or
 
leadership
 
roles,
 
using
 
this
 
data
 
to
 
reﬁne
 
the
 
scope
 
and
 
content
 
of
 
future
 
programs.

or
 
strategic
 
votes—that
 
walk
 
ﬁrst-time
 
participants
 
through
 
every
 
step
 
of
 
the
 
process.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Offer
 
on-demand
 
videos
 
or
 
interactive
 
modules
 
so
 
members
 
can
 
learn
 
about
 
governance
 
at
 
their
 
own
 
pace.
 
Encourage
 
branches
 
or
 
local

and
 
meeting
 
materials
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
languages
 
spoken
 
by
 
Desjardins’
 
member
 
base.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Use
 
professional
 
translation
 
and
 
culturally
 
sensitive
 
messaging
 
for
 
all
 
core
 
governance
 
communications.
 
Track
 
how
 
many

○
 
Rationale
:
 
Setting
 
minimum
 
targets
 
for
 
underrepresented
 
groups
 
(e.g.,
 
women,
 
youth,
 
ethnic
 
minorities)
 
ensures
 
that
 
leadership
 
reﬂects
 
the
 
membership’s
 
demographic.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
M andate
 
that
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
certain
 
percentage
 
of
 
Board
 
candidates
 
hail
 
from
 
traditionally
 
underrepresented
 
segments.
 
Publicly
 
share
 
these

○
 
Objective
:
 
Identify
 
high-potential
 
members—particularly
 
from
 
underrepresented
 
backgrounds—and
 
pair
 
them
 
with
 
experienced
 
Board
 
members
 
or
 
executives.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Run
 
annual

to
 
measure
 
mentees’
 
progress,
 
including
 
their
 
readiness
 
to
 
assume
 
more
 
prominent
 
governance
 
roles.
 
If
 
mentees
 
do
 
not
 
progress
 
as
 
expected,
 
adjust
 
the
 
program’s
 
structure
 
(m ore

specialized
 
training)
 
to
 
better
 
address
 
skill
 
gaps.

○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Include

2.
 
Reporting
 
on
 
Impact
 
of
 
Member
 
Input
 
○
 
Goal
:
 
Demonstrate
 
that
 
member
 
feedback
 
directly
 
inﬂuences
 
governance
 
decisions,
 
reinforcing
 
trust
 
and
 
encouraging
 
ongoing
 
engagement.

○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
After
 
major
 
votes
 
or
 
strategic
 
consultations,
 
release
 
a
 
summary
 
of
 
how
 
member
 
suggestions
 
shaped
 
ﬁnal
 
policies
 
(e.g.,
 
“Based
 
on
 
member
 
feedback,
 
we
 
adjusted
 
interest
 
rates
 
on
 
green
 
loans
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
competitive”).
 
This
 
closes
 
the
 
feedback
 
loop
 
and
 
motivates
 
further
 
participation.
By
 
actively
 
expanding
 
outreach
 
to
 
underrepresented
 
groups,
 
providing
 
user-friendly
 
education,
 
and
 
maintaining
 
transparent
 
data
 
on
 
member
 
involvement,
 
Desjardins
 
ensures
 
that
 
democratic
 
governance
 
remains
 
inclusive,
 
equitable,
 
and
 
reﬂective
 
of
 
the
 
full
 
breadth
 
of
 
its
 
membership.
 
These
 
efforts
 
not
 
only
 
uphold
 
the
 
cooperative’s
 
foundational
 
ideals
 
but
 
also
 
enrich
 
strategic
 
decision-making
 
with
 
a
 
multiplicity
 
of
 
perspectives.

4.2.3
 
Building
 
a
 
Culture
 
of
 
Democratic
 
Engagement
Beyond
 
offering
 
accessible
 
voting
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
inclusive
 
governance
 
structures,
 
Desjardins
 
must
 
cultivate
 
a
 
culture
 
where
 
every
 
member
 
understands—and
 
is
 
motivated
 
to
 
embrace—cooperative
 
principles.
 
By
 
prioritizing
 
education,
 
recognition,
 
and

might
 
include
 
organizing
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
literacy
 
workshop,
 
while
 
a
 
stint
 
in
 
technology
 
could
 
involve
 
piloting

Embedding
 
Accountability
 
and
 
Innovation
 
into
 
Leadership
 
Practices
A
 
strong
 
culture
 
of
 
excellence
 
at
 
Desjardins
 
stems
 
from
 
leaders
 
who
 
are
 
both
 
accountable
 
and
 
innovative.
 
To
 
maintain
 
a
 
high-performance
 
environment
 
that
 
aligns
 
with
 
cooperative
 
values,
 
bank
 
directors
 
must
 
ensure
 
leaders
 
have
 
clear
 
metrics,
 
structured
 
review
 
processes,
 
and
 
the
 
freedom
 
to
 
experiment
 
with
 
new
 
ideas.
 
Below
 
are
 
key
 
steps
 
and
 
actionable
 
strategies
 
to
 
achieve
 
this.
Deﬁning
 
Accountability
 
Metrics
1.
 
Alignment
 
with
 
Cooperative
 
Values
 
○
 
Approach
:
 
Tie
 
leadership
 
performance
 
directly
 
to
 
Desjardins’
 
mission—focusing
 
on
 
member
 
satisfaction,
 
community
 
impact,
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
ﬁnancial
 
outcomes.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Break
 
down
 
each
 
metric
 
into
 
quantiﬁable
 
targets.
 
For
 
example,
 
set
 
a
 
minimum
 
increase
 
in
 
member
 
satisfaction
 
scores
 
(e.g.,
 
5%
 
year-over-year)
 
and
 
track
 
progress
 
quarterly.
 
Include
 
environmental,
 
social,
 
and
 
governance
 
(ESG)
 
goals—such
 
as
 
reducing
 
operational
 
carbon
 
footprint
 
or
 
increasing
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
loans
 
dedicated
 
to
 
green
 
projects.
2.
 
Performance
 
Dashboards
 
○
 
Purpose
:
 
Provide
 
leaders
 
with
 
a
 
real-time
 
snapshot
 
of
 
how
 
they’re
 
meeting
 
member
 
engagement,
 
innovation,
 
and
 
operational
 
targets.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Automate
 
dashboard
 
updates
 
using
 
data
 
from
 
relevant
 
internal
 
systems
 
(e.g.,
 
CRM
 
for
 
member
 
satisfaction,
 
project
 
management
 
tools
 
for
 
innovation
 
initiatives).
 
Require
 
monthly
 
or
 
quarterly
 
reviews
 
at
 
the
 
leadership
 
level
 
to
 
identify
 
variances
 
and
 
plan
 
corrective
 
measures.
Accountability
 
Structures

Structured
 
Review
 
Processes
 
○
 
Regular
 
One-on-One
 
Reviews
:
 
Schedule
 
consistent
 
check-ins
 
(e.g.,
 
monthly
 
or
 
bi-monthly)
 
between
 
executives
 
and
 
team
 
leaders
 
to
 
discuss
 
goal
 
progress,
 
obstacles,
 
and
 
next
 
steps.
○
 
Peer
 
Reviews
:
 
Encourage
 
teams
 
to
 
evaluate
 
each
 
other’s
 
contributions
 
and
 
share
 
feedback,
 
fostering
 
collaborative
 
accountability.

○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Create
 
a
 
standardized
 
“review
 
template”
 
capturing
 
highlights,
 
lowlights,
 
key
 
lessons,
 
and
 
immediate
 
action
 
items.
 
Distribute
 
these
 
summaries
 
to
 
relevant
 
executives
 
or
 
committees
 
to
 
ensure
 
transparency
 
and
 
follow-through.
2.
 
Performance
 
Management
 
Software
 
○
 
Usage
:
 
Employ
 
digital
 
tools
 
that
 
track
 
goal
 
completion,
 
performance
 
metrics,
 
and
 
feedback
 
in
 
a
 
central
 
repository—making
 
it
 
easier
 
to
 
monitor
 
trends
 
and
 
hold
 
leadership
 
accountable.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Integrate
 
this
 
software
 
with
 
daily
 
workﬂows
 
(e.g.,
 
meeting
 
agendas,
 
email
 
reminders)
 
so
 
leaders
 
regularly
 
update
 
progress
 
and
 
address
 
ﬂagged
 
issues
 
promptly.

new
 
concepts—even
 
if
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
outcome
 
is
 
a
 
pivot
 
or
 
a
 
learning
 
opportunity.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Include
 
a
 
“lessons
 
learned”
 
debrief
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
pilot
 
project
 
to
 
share
 
valuable
 
insights
 
across
 
the

competition,
 
climate
 
risk).
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Collect
 
actionable
 
ideas
 
during

roadmap.
 
Assign
 
executive
 
sponsors
 
to
 
monitor
 
implementation
 
milestones,
 
ensuring
 
continuous
 
progress.
By
 
clearly
 
deﬁning
 
accountability
 
metrics,
 
implementing
 
rigorous
 
review
 
processes,
 
and
 
cultivating
 
an
 
atmosphere
 
that
 
rewards
 
innovation
 
and
 
calculated
 
risk-taking,
 
Desjardins
 
reinforces
 
a
 
culture
 
of
 
excellence.
 
For
 
bank
 
directors,
 
the
 
result
 
is
 
a
 
leadership
 
team
 
empowered
 
to
 
drive
 
performance,

Aligning
 
Incentives
 
with
 
Desjardins’
 
Cooperative
 
Mission
To
 
sustain
 
a
 
culture
 
of
 
excellence,
 
Desjardins
 
must
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
incentive
 
programs—both
 
monetary
 
and
 
non-monetary—directly
 
reinforce
 
cooperative
 
values
 
and
 
member-centric
 
outcomes.
 
By
 
linking
 
rewards
 
to
 
mission-driven
 
performance
 
metrics
 
and
 
celebrating
 
achievements
 
aligned
 
with
 
Desjardins’
 
founding
 
principles,
 
the
 
organization
 
fosters
 
leadership
 
behaviors
 
that
 
prioritize
 
long-term
 
member
 
beneﬁt
 
over
 
short-term
 
gains.

○
 
Approach
:
 
M ove

by
 
tying
 
variable
 
compensation
 
to
 
metrics
 
such
 
as

growth,
 
sustainability
 
benchmarks
 
(e.g.,
 
reduction
 
in
 
carbon
 
footprint
 
or
 
green
 
loan
 
portfolio
 
expansion),
 
and
 
team
 
engagement
 
scores.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
For
 
each
 
leadership
 
role,
 
designate
 
a
 
set
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
annual
 
bonus
 
linked
 
to
 
cooperative
 
outcomes.
 
For
 
instance,
 
if
 
a
 
branch
 
manager
 
successfully
 
boosts
 
member
 
retention
 
rates
 
or
 
achieves
 
community
 
reinvestment
 
targets,
 
they
 
receive
 
a
 
proportional
 
increase
 
in
 
incentive
 
pay.

advanced
 
cooperative
 
governance
 
to
 
reward
 
and
 
further
 
develop
 
high-performing
 
leaders.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Keep
 
a

By
 
tying

Advanced
 
Compliance
 
Tools
 
for
 
Real-Time
 
Monitoring
In
 
an
 
increasingly
 
complex
 
regulatory
 
landscape,
 
Desjardins
 
must
 
deploy
 
proactive,
 
high-performance
 
tools
 
to
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
and
 
mitigate
 
operational,
 
ﬁnancial,
 
and
 
reputational
 
risks.
 
By
 
centralizing
 
risk
 
data,
 
automating
 
routine
 
compliance
 
checks,
 
and
 
fortifying
 
cybersecurity,
 
Desjardins
 
can
 
swiftly
 
respond
 
to
 
threats
 
and
 
maintain
 
trust
 
with
 
members,
 
regulators,
 
and
 
the
 
broader
 
community.

Centralized,
 
Continuous
 
Tracking
 
○
 
Approach
:
 
Implement
 
a
 
uniﬁed
 
risk
 
management
 
platform
 
that
 
consolidates
 
data
 
from
 
all
 
caisses,
 
enabling
 
leadership
 
to
 
identify
 
anomalies
 
and
 
potential
 
threats
 
(e.g.,
 
unusual
 
account
 
activity,
 
regulatory
 
gaps)
 
in
 
real
 
time.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Require
 
each
 
caisse
 
to
 
feed
 
transaction
 
data,
 
operational
 
logs,
 
and
 
compliance
 
records
 
into
 
this
 
platform
 
daily.
 
Set
 
alerts
 
for
 
critical
 
thresholds
 
(e.g.,
 
sudden
 
surge
 
in
 
chargebacks,
 
repeated
 
account
 
access
 
failures).
2.
 
AI-Driven
 
Anomaly

workﬂows.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Conduct
 
quarterly
 
reviews
 
of
 
AI
 
detection
 
accuracy—focus
 
on
 
reducing
 
false
 
positives
 
and
 
reﬁning
 
detection
 
logic
 
as
 
business
 
needs
 
evolve
 
(e.g.,
 
new
 
products,
 
payment
 
methods).
3.

are
 
highest
 
(e.g.,
 
major
 
capital
 
projects,
 
partnerships
 
with
 
external
 
vendors,
 
digital
 
transformation
 
initiatives).

M aintain
 
a
 
“Risk
 
Heat
 
M ap”
 
and
 
update
 
it
 
after
 
each
 
audit
 
cycle.
 
If
 
certain
 
areas
 
repeatedly
 
show
 
vulnerabilities—like
 
compliance
 
gaps
 
in
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
region—allocate
 
additional
 
auditing
 
resources
 
and
 
training
 
for
 
that

In
 
addition
 
to
 
standard
 
ﬁnancial
 
reports,
 
provide
 
executives
 
and
 
the
 
Board
 
with
 
concise
 
presentations
 
of
 
member
 
growth,
 
innovation
 
metrics
 
(e.g.,
 
new
 
product
 
uptake),
 
and
 
ESG
 
progress.

Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Create
 
a
 
“Top
 
Five
 
Trends”
 
slide
 
summarizing
 
the
 
quarter’s
 
most
 
notable
 
shifts—e.g.,
 
a
 
surge
 
in
 
mobile
 
banking
 
usage,
 
improvement
 
in
 
green
 
loan
 
adoption—and
 
pair
 
each
 
trend
 
with
 
recommended
 
responses
 
or
 
further
 
investigation
 
items.

M odel
 
various
 
economic
 
or
 
regulatory
 
scenarios
 
(e.g.,
 
interest
 
rate
 
spikes,
 
a
 
regional
 
economic
 
downturn)
 
to
 
predict
 
potential
 
impacts
 
on
 
KPIs
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
stability.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
If
 
simulations
 
project
 
signiﬁcant
 
negative
 
effects
 
on
 
liquidity
 
or
 
credit
 
quality,
 
consider
 
implementing
 
hedging
 
strategies,
 
adjusting
 
loan
 
terms,
 
or
 
reallocating
 
resources
 
to
 
mitigate
 
risk.
 
Document
 
these
 
analyses
 
for

○
 
Executive
 
Input
 
on
 
KPIs
:
 
Encourage
 
senior
 
leaders
 
to
 
offer
 
real-time
 
feedback
 
on
 
which
 
metrics
 
remain
 
most
 
relevant,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
system
 
adapts
 
to
 
Desjardins’
 
evolving
 
priorities.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Host
 
a
 
quarterly
 
“KPI
 
Alignment
 
W orkshop”
 
where
 
executives
 
discuss
 
the
 
current
 
set
 
of
 
metrics,
 
propose
 
new
 
ones
 
if
 
organizational
 
goals
 
shift
 
(e.g.,
 
expanding
 
sustainable
 
ﬁnance),
 
and
 
retire
 
or
 
modify
 
outdated
 
measures.

Accuracy
 
and
 
Reliability
 
Checks
:
 
Conduct
 
annual
 
reviews
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
sources
 
feeding
 
into
 
dashboards,
 
verifying
 
that
 
information
 
(e.g.,
 
transactions,
 
risk
 
ﬂags)
 
is
 
accurate,
 
timely,
 
and
 
meets
 
regulatory
 
standards.
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Task
 
a
 
cross-functional
 
“System
 
Integrity
 
Team”
 
to
 
test
 
new
 
features
 
or
 
external
 
integrations
 
(e.g.,
 
updated
 
ﬁntech
 
platforms).
 
Document
 
results
 
and
 
adjust
 
software
 
conﬁgurations
 
as
 
needed.
2.
 
Measuring
 
Effectiveness
 

○
 
Efficiency
 
and
 
Alignment
:
 
Track
 
how
 
quickly
 
executives
 
can
 
identify
 
and
 
respond
 
to
 
emerging
 
issues
 
or
 
underperformance.
 
Evaluate
 
whether
 
the
 
system
 
helps
 
maintain
 
strategic
 
alignment
 
(e.g.,
 
balancing
 
ﬁnancial
 
success
 
with
 
community
 
investments).
○
 
Actionable
 
Tip
:
 
Deploy
 
brief
 
surveys
 
after
 
each
 
quarterly
 
review
 
to
 
gather
 
feedback
 
on
 
the
 
clarity,
 
usability,
 
and
 
actionability
 
of
 
the
 
reporting.
 
If
 
certain
 
metrics
 
or
 
dashboard
 
views
 
cause
 
confusion,
 
reﬁne
 
the
 
interface
 
or
 
provide
 
additional
 
training.
By
 
developing
 
sophisticated
 
real-time
 
analytics,
 
reﬁning
 
quarterly
 
reporting,
 
and
 
systematically
 
evaluating
 
monitoring
 
tools,
 
Desjardins
 
equips
 
its
 
executive
 
team
 
with
 
the
 
insights
 
needed
 
to
 
stay
 
agile
 
and
 
mission-focused.
 
This
 
holistic
 
approach
 
ensures
 
leadership
 
can
 
proactively
 
address
 
challenges,
 
seize
 
new
 
opportunities,
 
and
 
uphold
 
the
 
cooperative
 
principles
 
that
 
deﬁne
 
Desjardins’
 
identity.
