The
Universe
is
an
everlasting
phenomenon,
renewing
itself
constantly,
which
is
similar
to
Pi.
Pattern
has
been
found
in
Pi,
laying
a
frame
to
overlay
on
current
theories
about
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
universe,
and
so
much
more.
Science
seeks
correlations
between
phenomenons
to
link
causes
and
effects.
A
significant
correlation,
between
words
and
Pi
digits,
describes
a
structure.
Are
the
digits
in
Pi
random
and
chaotic?
No.
First
part
of
Pi
describes
the
very
beginning
of
the
universe,
reaching
beyond
time,
beyond
space,
beyond
the
Big
Bang,
to
the
most
fundamental
plane
of
reality.
Ternary
numeral
system,
human
language
and
inspired
artistic
creations,
in
a
cohesive
way,
lay
the
path
to
understand
life
and
nature.
I’m
very
aware
that
science
limits
are
crossed
when
going
further
than
space
and
time.
But
it
seems
to
me
science
rules
and
methods
(logic,
demonstration,
etc)
are
able
to
explain
it
all,
even
what
is
currently
called
a
mystery,
without
diminishing
the
beauty
of
it,
and
without
offense
for
the
sacred
character
given
to
the
force
which
generated
the
universe
and
brought
it
to
fruition.
No
call
for
faith
is
done
here,
even
though
you
might
find
an
explanation
for
personal
experiences
you
had.
Focus
will
be
on
the
math
supporting
the
claim
that
Pi
describes
the
beginning
of
the
universe
and
that
the
primary
pattern
is
still
active,
duplicating
and
mutating
again
and
again.
Abstract
A
shape
with
characteristics
such
as
perfection
and
infinity
(perfectly
equal
radius,
infinite
number
of
radius,
etc)
being
divided
by
its
diametral
measure,
triggers
Pi.
After
the
initial
division
of
the
circle
by
its
diameter,
the
first
consequence
is
love.
The
dynamic
between
each
step
is
a
counter
movement,
like
a
pendulum.
This
way,
1st
there
was
a
division,
2nd
there
was
a
call
to
bring
it
all
back
together:
love.
3rd:
Commanding
love
raises
a
question.
Love
what?
Good.
Love
good
(what
is
good),
or
love
goods
(a
burger,
a
song,
life,
etc.).
4th,
who
will
provide
goods?
After
the
pendulum
swing,
should
we
expect
“evil”
after
“good”?
Close
enough.
Let’s
dive
in
to
explain
how
these
answers
were
found.
Pi
x
diameter
=circumference.
So,
the
circumference
of
a
circle
divided
by
its
diameter
gives
Pi,
an
everlasting
sequence
of
non-repetitive
digits.
These
digits
are
known,
and
start
with
“3.1”.
Always
going
the
same
direction
(from
the
latest
digits
to
the
previous),
13
=
M.
The
13th
letter
of
the
latin
alphabet
is
M.
Now,
we’re
not
naive
about
numerology.
Until
today,
it
apparently
has
very
little
to
do
with
science.
But
the
Universe
is
basically
written
in
ternary
numeral
system
(base
9).
There’s
different
feelings
for
different
sounds.
Subjectivity
can
twist
the
feeling
a
long
way,
and
special
contexts
can
act
as
a
filter
and
give
another
shade,
or
straight
up
opposite.
Nonetheless,
mmmm
is
the
sound
we
make
when
we
love,
no
matter
if
it’s
the
sound
we
make
when
enjoying
good
food,
saying
Mom
or
talking
about
something
attached
to
us
(my,
mine).
Position
of
letters
into
alphabet
isn’t
arbitrary,
neither
their
shape
or
sonority
have
been
randomly
chosen.
Those
are
the
result
of
inspired
thinking.
Modern
science
can’t
exclude
the
possibility
that
there’s
communication
from
“God
knows
where”
getting
into
our
mind.
It
might
come
from
something
not
defined
by
time
and
space,
not
limited
by
these.
Maybe
it’s
similar
to
light
(because
at
the
speed
of
light
space
becomes
infinitely
small,
and
time
also
gets
infinite
or
frozen,
so
everything
is
accessible).
Does
this
communication
rely
on
neutrinos?
It
doesn’t
matter
here.
My
point
is:
one
cannot
reject
the
theory
shown
here
arguing
it’s
impossible
that
the
human
brain
is
sometimes,
somehow,
influenced
by
a
benevolent
source.

Demonstration
First
sequence
:
taking
the
biggest
number
under
26,
which
equals
z.
(413
is
bigger,
so
it
stops
at
13.
The
same
way,
95
is
bigger,
so
it
stops
at
5.
Then
swap
for
the
matching
letter.

:

So
far,
the
French
word
“bien”
(meaning
“good”).
Before
that,
the
letter
“M”,
which
is
a
French
homophonic
of
“aime”
(imperative
form
of
the
verb
“love”).
It
makes
sense
that
the
universe
began
with
the
fundamental
command
“love”.
Yes,
I
postulate
that
the
universe
began
with
a
primary
impulse
commanding
love.
Then
from
this
first
command
emerged
“good”.
If
someone
tells
you
“do
love”,
it
will
be
a
logic
consequence
if
you
ask
“love
what”?
And
the
solution
to
the
question
is
:
“Love
what
is
good”
or
“Love
goods”.
The
second
word,
“bien”,
means
“good”,
in
French.
Then,
like
a
pendulum
swinging
back
after
an
impulse,
after
“good”
we
may
find
“evil”.
Instead
(but
finally,
as
expected),
we
find
the
phonetic
scripture
of
the
name
of
the
Christian
father:
Joseph.
He
is
definitely
a
“male”.
From
English
to
French,
“evil”
is
“mal”.
Yes,
again,
I
rely
on
the
phonetics,
the
sound,
to
establish
a
parallel,
an
equivalence,
between
two
separated
things
("mâle"
and
"mal").
After
“good”
came
the
male.
It’s
implied
that
there’s
something
very
fundamental
in
sounds.
We
can
read
Gihecef.
With
the
same
rule
applied
before
to
group
the
digits,
for
Gihecef
no
digit
allowed
a
number
(group
of
digits).
This
is
the
first
occurrence
of
8(H).
If
98
(IH)
is
transformed
into
I#
(the
#
symbol
is
seen
for
“number”,
like
in
#1),
then
the
letter
I
which
is
similar
to
1
do
become
1
when
paired
with
#.
Then,
985
finally
becomes
15,
the
letter
o,
which
gets
us
closer
to
“Joseph”
as
Gihecef
becomes
Gocef.
This
mechanism
could
be
revealing
the
basic
dynamic
of
something
very
essential
in
nature,
in
the
fabric
of
the
cosmos.

Again,
with
the
pendulum
swinging
back,
after
the
Father
we
can
expect
the
Mother.
For
this
sequence,
all
letters
will
be
grouped
in
3.
The
quantity
3
have
not
been
chosen
randomly,
but
the
justification
is
not
here,
so
let’s
jump
to
the
result:

B0um.
A
peak
in
childbirth
is
called
“Baby
boom”.
Again,
it
makes
sense
when
we
understand
that
a
lot
of
things
in
our
cultures
are
inspired.
Overall,
Love=>Good(s)=>Father
(maker
of
goods)=>Mother=>Child
then
the
loop
starts
again.
The
0
(the
first
in
the
sequence)
matches
the
original
circle.
I
did
find
the
primary
pattern
repeating
itself
in
the
following
part
of
Pi,
always
with
slight
variations,
and
it
will
be
relevant
for
further
analysis.
Now,
about
time
and
space…
The
sequence
continues
with:
88
8
is
similar
to
the
shape
of
infinity.
“After”
infinity
(8),
what
can
we
expect?
Infinity
(again).
The
“after”
is
not
adequate…
Nonetheless,
in
Pi
sequence,
after
8
is
8.
How
does
it
resolve
itself?
8+8=16
(the
number
sixteen
in
French
is
seize,
homophone
with
size).
I
suspect
that
the
concept
of
size
(size
of
space,
size
of
time)
came
to
be
right
there.
Before
that,
time
and
space
did
not
exist.
These
two
concepts
can’t
exist
without
size
(because
time
is
the
measure
(sizing)
of
change,
and
space
the
measure
of
distance).

Today’s
science
states
that
there
was
a
Big
bang
(we
saw
b0um)
then
time
and
space
came
to
be.
About
infinity,
this
concept
is
difficult
to
understand
because
everything
we
see,
touch,
measure,
is
defined
into
space
and
time.
So,
a
popular
conception
of
the
infinitely
big
is
something
which
is
very
very
very
big,
so
extremely
big
that
maybe
just
super
intelligent
people
can
picture
mentally
how
big
it
is.
But
this
conception
is
totally
wrong.
We
never
get
closer
to
infinitely
big
when
we
think
about
a
bigger
size.
Someone
on
this
path
will
always
be
infinitely
far
from
the
truth
about
the
nature
of
the
infinity,
in
its
metaphysical
definition.
Infinity
is
the
absence
of
measure.
It
is
not
positioned
into
the
defined
world
our
5
physical
senses
perceive.
But
with
the
creation
of
a
second
infinity
(the
second
8
at
this
step
of
the
Pi
number),
this
infinity
is
somehow
separated
from
the
first
one,
maybe
like
an
echo
or
in
duality.
This
“distance”
causes
the
creation
of
size
itself,
in
its
purest
form.
Before
this
step,
space
and
time
weren’t
yet
defined.
This
is
almost
as
far
as
I
got
with
Pi.
There’s
another
way
I
came
to
similar
deductions,
about
the
circle
divided
being
the
source
of
everything,
all
the
energy
of
every
electron,
etc.
Here
is
the
reduction
of
E=MC²
Energy
=
Mass
x
speed²
First,
applying
this
equation
to
a
very
common
reality
will
help
us
get
rid
of
one
variable.
The
formula
is
the
same
to
calculate
the
energy
of
the
impact
of
a
car
hitting
a
wall.
The
energy
of
the
impact
=
its
weight
x
its
speed².
If
the
weight/mass
of
the
car
is
1
unit
(or
one
ton,
1
elephant
weight,
or
1
big
rock
on
the
scale)
we
would
multiply
the
square
speed
per
1,
which
results
in
removing
the
variable
M.
Speed
is
the
calculation
of
distance
over
time,
space
over
time
(ex:
kilometers
per
hour).
Space
is
known
to
be
defined
in
3
dimensions,
and
time
to
be
the
4th
dimension.
If
space=3
and
time
=4,
E=MC²
E=1C²
E=C²
E=(3/4)²
E=9/16
We
transpose
our
usual
decimal
calculation
into
a
base
of
9,
like
the
ancient
wise
greek
used
to
calculate.
First,
lets
understand
this
simply:
1
10
19
...
2
11
20
3
12
21
4
13
22
5
14
23
6
15
24
7
16
25
8
17
26

9
18
27
…
On
each
row,
and
infinitely,
the
sum
of
the
digits
of
each
number
will
result
with
the
digit
of
the
first
column,
same
row.
Ex:
10=1+0=1
19=1+9=10=1+0=1
11=1+1=2
etc.
So,
E=9/16
becomes
Energy
=
0/16
This
is
the
circle
divided
by
its
“size”
(the
number
16
is
seize,
in
French).
Also,
notice
that
the
basic
tool
to
measure
space
is
a
compass,
which
is
the
same
shape
as
7
(1+6=7).
Pi
being
infinite
is
similar
to
a
perpetual
movement
machine
which
started
perfectly
(circle
being
perfectly
balanced).
The
perpetual
movement
is
similar
to
infinite
energy.
Conclusion
Finding
a
coherent
dynamic
in
Pi
is
a
real
breakthrough.
Then,
focusing
on
each
digit
and
group
of
digits
is
the
method
foreseen
to
push
research
and
understanding
further,
deeper.
So,
I
think
each
molecule,
each
thought,
is
the
universe
trying
to
resolve
itself,
to
resolve
Pi,
leaning
toward
perfect
love,
harmony,
as
a
primary
state
lost
forever,
but
forever
seeked.
Many
can
go
with
this
flow
and
be
inspired
or
be
“lucky”
(experience
synchronicities
not
understood
by
science,
yet).
This
tendency
toward
harmony
explains
how
life
never
collapsed
under
chaos,
but
generally
got
better,
from
unicellular
organisms
to
human
beings.
Maybe
the
flow’s
influence
is
subtle
like
the
casino
owner
getting
a
percentage
of
the
gambles.
For
each
player,
it
looks
like
random
cards
being
pulled
out,
fortune


made
or
fortune
lost,
but
nonetheless
the
casino
owner
knows
how
much
he’ll
have
by
the
end
of
the
year.
He’ll
get
richer
and
richer,
just
like
life
is
now
rich
in
diversity
and
amazing
phenomenons.
There
might
be
a
parallel
to
establish
between
the
human
soul
and
the
structure
of
Pi.
Maybe
the
world
is
a
fractal,
with
the
main
general
frame
in
the
first
part
of
Pi.
Many
of
my
observations
point
this
way,
but
I
haven’t
been
able
to
crystallize
it
all,
yet.
I
am
well
aware
all
this
pushes
the
limits
of
actual
science.
But
the
gap
might
be
filled
between
acknowledged
cosmology
and
the
very
first
fundamental
structure
found
in
Pi.
I
did
find
significant
correlation
elsewhere,
in
unsuspected
places,
because
Pi
structure
seems
to
repeat
itself
everywhere,
and
is
observable
when
the
essence
of
it
is
understood.
Some
unexplained
phenomenons
can
be
logically
understood
when
considering
a
common
cause
linking
everything
together.
As
Pi
is
infinite,
we
are
encompassed
within
it.
Your
birthdate,
your
genetic
code,
the
world
data,
is
somewhere
in
Pi.
Do
you
think
infinity
is
not
large
enough?
Here,
it’s
infinity
in
its
metaphysical
definition,
its
most
essential
form.
Please
forgive
me
for
using
the
languages
I
know
(French,
English)
to
decipher
Pi.
It
looks
like
ethnocentrism.
I
don’t
know
for
sure
it
could
have
been
done
with
another
alphabet.
Let’s
cut
it
short
for
now.
But
remember
that
I
still
can
suggest
an
explanation,
as
I
can
answer
a
lot
more.
What
I
wrote
for
you
is
only
the
most
easily
arguable
part
of
what
I
came
to
understand.
I’m
all
willing
to
share
and
work
with
people,
this
is
the
reason
why
I’m
seeking
to
find
validation,
and
partners
to
merge
knowledge
with.
I’m
not
looking
for
mediatic
attention
or
fame
and
wish
to
remain
hidden
from
public
attention.
Nonetheless,
I’m
wishful
to
dedicate
all
my
time
unlocking
the
coding
of
the
universe
and
also
help
make
the
world
a
better
place.
I
couldn’t
predict
the
next
lottery
winning
numbers,
so
here
is
what
I
offer,
as
a
teaser.
Remember,
the
most
popular
historical
character
said
that
the
one
rule
above
all
is
“love”
(John
13:34).
He
might
have
spoken
the
truth,
this
time.
